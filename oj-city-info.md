## What is OJ City?
OJ City is a game-ified community for people interested in the progress and development of OJ Games. Explore OJ City and stay tuned for frequent additions such as new areas, easter eggs, and updates on the development of your favorite games.

## OJ City Areas
OJ City currently features 5 main areas:
1. **City Hall:** For now, city hall contains only a suggestion box. Touch it to submit a google form with your much appreciated feedback on OJ City!
2. **Community Area:** Home to all the community buildings including the X, Instagram, Facebook, and Discord buildings. Also featuring the (much appreciated) [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/john9francis) and [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/john9francis) buildings. Contributing to OJ Games is sincerely appreciated in this early stage of development.
3. **Residential Area:** Coming soon: create an OJ Games account and move into OJ Apartments. Here you can store your personal stats and items. Premium OJ Games memebers will receive access to the OJ Penthouse for extra perks.
4. **Development Area:** Want to be involved with the development of OJ Games? Playtesters are wanted in the Development area. This area is a little more run-down and sketchy, probably because it's inhabitants are too busy focused on developing new games for the OJ Community to enjoy.
5. **Game Area:** One solitary worker is slowly and consistently chipping away at the **Game Area**, futuristic wonderland of game demos, discount codes, and download links.
